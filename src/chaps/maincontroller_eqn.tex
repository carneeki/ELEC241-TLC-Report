\section{Main Controller Equations}
According to the specifications provided for dealing with traffic any from
combination of sources, the controller chip takes the system through a specific
progression each time a particular sensor combination is input and it is already
on flow 1, those progressions as part of the specifications will not be listed
here, however their implementation can be explained in terms of the following
basic concept:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=,breaklines=true,numbers=none]
Information about(Current flow + current \HIGH sensors) = knowledge of next flow
\end{lstlisting}
Since each circumstance or current state of the system is unique, we can deal
with them deterministically (ie there is no redundancy, each case is considered
in the equations exactly once). Following are the equations, please note
\texttt{X} $\to$ \texttt{Y} means this is the equation term dealing with the
case of flow \texttt{X} finishing and leading to flow \texttt{Y} If the sensor
conditions are correct.

Please note, each \ENX formula contains a specific term to ``Maintain'' that
enable until the flow is complete, in the form \ENX * /\FFX.

The main controller equations have been describe in table \ref{tab:MCeqn} on
page \pageref{tab:MCeqn}.
