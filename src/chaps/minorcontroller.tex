\section{Minor Controller}
As already mentioned in the High Level Design, due to the limited number of
inputs, we had to implement a very simple minor controller that assists in the
logic. Because flows 4, 5 and 6 all lead directly back to flow 1, this was
possible. Our minor controller is as follows:
\subsection{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \FF{4}
  \item \FF{5}
  \item \FF{6}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{\FF{456} = \FF{4} + \FF{5} + \FF{6}}
\end{itemize}
If this were to be implemented in a real world situation, authors would
recommend replacing the expensive GAL controller with a relatively inexpensive
3 input NOR gate such as a \texttt{4025} or \texttt{7427} which presently retail
for approximately \$0.40, compared with \$22.60 (prices for single unit
quantites as at 21:43, 16 October 2012 from RS Components Australia).
