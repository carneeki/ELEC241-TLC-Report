\section{Flow 2,4,5,6 Chips}
Flows 2, 4, 5 and 6 are identical (except a slight difference in flow 4), even
though in the case of flow 2 the complexity of a left and right light is not
required, nevertheless that doesn't matter in this case as either left or right
outputs could be used to feed to the lights. 

\subsection{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \EN
  \item \texttt{BudLG} (buddy Left Green, means flow 1's requests for green)
  \item \texttt{BudRG}
  \item \texttt{BudLA}
  \item \texttt{BudRA}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \FF
  \item \texttt{GrL}
  \item \texttt{GrR}
  \item \texttt{AmL}
  \item \texttt{AmR}
  \item \texttt{ReL}
  \item \texttt{ReR}  (all six lights flows 5 \& 6 control)
  \item \Q{[0\ldots2]} (counter variables)
\end{itemize}

Flows 2, 5, and 6 are modified MOD 8 counters. Their logic for counter and FSM
has been listed in appendix table \ref{tab:F2456sm} on page \pageref{lst:F2456}
and code listing \ref{lst:F2456} on page \pageref{lst:F2456}.
