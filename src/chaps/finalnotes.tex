\section{Final Notes}
This design was version 3.2, our initial design failed because we tried to put
too much onto one chip and the equations became very complex, eventually we
abandoned this design. Thereafter we started a design 2 which is similar to
design 3 except the MOD counters for flows 2 - 6 were more complex with more
states (and four ticking variables) which again led to something too complex,
we wired this design up and it didn’t count properly, additionally we had not
put enough thought into how the flows control the traffic lights, leading us to
a system which simply didn’t work. 

Our final design was version 3, the design which we present as our solution,
when wired up it worked fine excepting three bugs in the system which were
resolved in versions 3.1 and 3.2. 

Our final version 3.2 still has room to improve however, the problem is that
whenever flow 1 goes to 5 or 6 all of the lights go red before flows 5 or 6
commence. This was indeed highlighted in the original specifications however
due to time constraints and previous failures we decided to get design 3 working
perfectly and leave it at this point. 

If we were to redesign the system in order to fix this problem we would have to
come up with some different light controller logic which would allow for a
smoother progression between those states.
